# Bank-System-Simulator
This program uses a custom created 2D hashMap to simulate a bank system. The program will read a .csv file and load the entries into a 2D hashmap of &lt;string, hashMap&lt;string, bankType>. bankType holds information like name, balance, pin, account number, and locked status. Output: Account information and deposit/withdraw transactions.
